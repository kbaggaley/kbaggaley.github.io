<h1>Data Journalism Project Pitches</h1>

<blockquote>
	
<h2>ALL ABOUT CUPCAKES</h2>

<p style="width:700px;">Are time-tested, reliable vanilla and chocolate the most popular cupcake flavors, or are more creative confections winning the day in NYC's bakeries? I have compiled a list of 23 cupcake shops or bakeries known for their cupcakes in NYC. I am interested in a chart of the most popular flavors, quantified as the flavors (or mix of key ingredients like almonds or chocolate fudge center) offered at the most stores. But some other possible questions are: </p>

<p style="width:700px;">Most popular flavor at each bakery?<p>
<p style="width:700px;">Most expensive flavor total?</p>
<p style="width:700px;">Most popular location? Or updating table version of that, or most popular flavor of the day? </p>
<p style="width:700px;">Price by flavor, or price by store?</p>
<p style="width:700px;">Most popular flavor in different neighborhoods (would work best for the neighborhoods with many cupcake shops, of which there are several)?</p>
<p style="width:700px;">Data on prices and flavors are available on the menu pages of each bakery website. Popular flavor data could come from contacting individual stores.

<h2>GRAFFITI</h2>

<p style="width:700px;">There is a dataset of graffiti-ed locations at NYC Open Data, with the date, address, and corresponding borough of each incident. I would like to find out what time of year graffiti occurred most; did the warmer weather encourage incidents or did graffiti artists prefer to act when cooler weather kept most people off the streets and let them act covertly (I could also find out the weather on the days with the most incidents to see if rainy/snowy weather discouraged graffiti artists or gave them undisturbed streets). My one concern is that by the time the graffiti incident was logged, the weather might have changed.</p>
<p style="width:700px;">I could also create a map of each neighborhood (or, more simply, each borough) to find out what neighborhood/borough has the most graffiti. </p>
<p style="width:700px;">Another possible route is to focus on one neighborhood or borough and find out what kind of building (storefront, apartment building, etc.) was most often targeted for defacement (if there was any way to create a program that could help me avoid doing this by hand, I would use the whole dataset). </p>
