		<h2>The When and Where of NYC's Graffiti</h2>
	<p>We see graffiti all over the place in New York City: on walls, storefronts, even on the pavement beneath our feet. But where and when does it get there? And how often does it happen? It turns out that graffiti artists favor certain times and especially places, and they are not always the ones that will get the most views...</p>
	<h3>Graffiti is more likely to occur in residential or less highly scrutinized spots</h3>
		<p>Graffiti occurs less often in office-dominated areas with heavier police presence. On Manhattan, graffiti is clustered most heavily in "u" shapes far uptown and downtown (approximately north of Lincoln Square and south of Washington Square Park). There is almost no graffiti in midtown or Central Park. It is also absent in lower Manhattan around the financial district. Central Park has fewer structures to deface, and police are particularly vigilant around focal points like Penn Station and Times Square, so even though these areas are very highly trafficked, they are graffitied less often.</p>
		<p>In the outer boroughs, graffiti is more evenly distributed, but appears to concentrate slightly along major roads and subway lines, which more people pass through. For instance, there is a cluster around Brighton Beach in Brooklyn. There is also cluster on Staten Island where the subway first meets the island.</p>
	<h3>Graffiti is on the rise</h3>
		<p>Graffiti incidents appear to increase over time, after dipping a bit during the colder winter months (winter had the fewest occurances of graffiti, spring the most; the dataset was cut off after only two months of summer, but we can infer that warmer weather is correlated with more graffiti). This correlates with an increase in New York City's population--the Census Bureau estimates that population increased by about 160,000 people. 
			<h3>Queens may be the least speedy borough to respond to graffiti</h3>
<p>	There are several spikes in graffiti incidents, most noticeably at November 4, 2010 and April 5, 2010. The majority of reports from both days issued from Queens. Both were mid-week days with no major events. It is unlikely that the incidents actually occurred on these days: the points reflect the day the incident was a spot in the database. Likely, Queens built up a backlog and has some difficulty keeping on top of its graffiti reports. But perhaps we can give them a break--the single most graffitied police precinct was located in Astoria.</p>
	
	<h3>More graffiti happens in Brooklyn</h3>
		<p>The proportion of graffiti incidents in each borough roughly mirrors the percentage of percentage of NYC's population in that borough. The highest percentage occurred in Brooklyn, the most heavily populated borough. But Manhattan and the Bronx had more than their fair share of incidents, with proportions of the graffiti incidents that were greater than their proportion of NYC's population. <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/census/popcur.shtml">Source: NYC Department of City Planning.</a></p>
